giter8 template for a simple scala script, enabled for the conscript
distribution system.

To test:

    ./run.sh "arg1 arg2 arg3 ..."

(It is currently needed to put the arguments in quotes. If anyone knows how to
fix the run script such that multiple arguments are correctly passed to sbt,
feel free to fix.)
